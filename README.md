# Update:

The  Weather Underground API was taken down... bummer :(

---------------------

A basic weather app.

View it here:
http://wellyweather.surge.sh/

Built with React.

Uses the Weather Underground API.

Currently hard-coded to Wellington seeing as it's intended audience is currently just myself and a handful of others.

TODOs:

* use actual sunset cutoff, instead of rounding to whole hour
* MAYBE add city/location change option... but checking weather outside of wellington is not a common use case.
